<p>
Hello! Thanks for taking you time to view my page. I am a joint Ph.D. student at the University of California, Irvine, Department of Computer Science (Donald Bren School) and San Diego State University. Previously, I completed my M.S. at the University of Nevada, Reno, Department of Computer Science and Engineering. I worked as a software engineer at World Mobile Inc.. I was a Software Engineer Intern at Tesla Inc. I received my B.S. degree in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, at the University of Tabriz, Iran.
<br/>
I have a strong background in statistics and machine learning, and I am able to use my skills to solve complex problems and extract valuable insights from data. I am also proficient in programming languages such as Python, dart, and so on, and I am able to develop custom algorithms, models, and applications to meet specific needs. I am also interested in big data and data engineering, and I am knowledgeable in Hadoop and Spark.
<br/>  
I was always interested in learning new things and developing my skills during my academic years. In addition, I would like to use my knowledge to make a difference in society. Through my studies in the field of Network Engineering, especially with CCNA and CCNP, I have developed many technical and soft skills including but not limited to network security, TCP/IP networking, routing protocols, and web servers.
<br/>  
I am looking for a position where I can use my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact on an organization.
<br/>
